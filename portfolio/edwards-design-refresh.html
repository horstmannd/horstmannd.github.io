		The agency the <a href="https://www.edwardsdesserts.com/" target="_blank">Edwards</a> brand team was working with proposed a design refresh. My job was to update the existing code base using HTML, CSS and JavaScript to implement this design refresh. The process required some container restructuring since we switched to full-width. Based on the brand teamâ€™s feedback, I designed and developed the <a href="https://www.edwardsdesserts.com/recipes/" target="_blank">recipe section</a>, which was featured in the <a href="http://www.latimes.com/bp/la-ara-31980-seize-the-holidays-with-4-festive-twists-on-decadent-desserts-20171121-adstory.html" target="_blank">Los Angeles Times</a> and <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/bp/chi-ara-31980-seize-the-holidays-with-4-festive-twists-on-decadent-desserts-20171121-adstory.html" target="_blank">Chicago Tribune</a>.
