		The focus of <a href="http://dustinhorstmann.com/js-resume-builder/" target="_blank">this example</a> isn't so much the presentation as it is what is working
		behind the scenes.
	</p>
	<p>
		My online degree's final project was to create a resume builder powered by
		JavaScript. They provided us with a basic template then taught us how to
		store data in JS objects, create functions to iterate through that data,
		then display it on the page with jQuery.

		then see the <a href="https://github.com/horstmannd/js-resume-builder/tree/gh-pages/js" target="_blank">JS files</a> powering it.
