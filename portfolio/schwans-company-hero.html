		My manager asked me to propose ideas for the hero section on the landing page of <a href="https://www.schwanscompany.com/" target="_blank">Schwanâ€™s Company</a>. My hero video idea was accepted. I searched through a video archive and selected footage then cut it together in Adobe Premiere. Finally, I optimized it for the web and used HTML and CSS to implement it with a text overlay.
