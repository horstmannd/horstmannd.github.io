        I really liked the web.
    </p>
    <p>
        Some things you like and don't know why. I was fortunate to get a job in college working for the web department. My boss helped me get my first freelance job making a website for a small business.

        These experiences helped me get a job after graduation at a design firm as a web developer. In 2016, I realized I needed to take my web skills to the next level, so I completed an online degree at Udacity and also started to take courses at Treehouse.

        I am currently employed as a Front End Web Developer with Schwan's Shared Services, LLC.
